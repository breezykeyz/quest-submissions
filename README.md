Chapter 1 Day 1 Quests

1. A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital    format.

  The Blockchain is an open, decentralized, shared database that allows anyone to store data publically.

2. Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met.


3.  A script is used to VIEW data on the Blockchain, they do not change it. Scripts are free to use.
   A transaction CHANGES the data on the Blockchain, and usually is the ONLY way we can change the data on the Blockchain.It is a glorified paid function call.

 
Chapter 1 Day 2 Quests

1. The 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars are :
i. Safety & Security
ii. Clarity
iii. Approachability
iv. Developer Experience
v. Resource Oriented Programming


2. In my opinion the 5 Pillars are useful because: 
i. the system has to be fail proof, you should be able to have rest of mind knowing that your coins cannot be stolen by a hacker. 
ii. The codes should be very clear to a new developer that didn't write the codes for the DApp to enhance its mainteinability.
iii. The codes should be approachable to a developer that has knowledge of other programming languages to facilitate a swift transition. 
iv. The programmer should be able to easily debug & correct errors in the code  
v. Cadence is an interpreted language.
Resources are a composite data type, similar to a struct, that expresses direct ownership of assets.  Cadenceâ€™s strong static type system ensures that resources can only exist in one location at a time and cannot be copied or lost because of a coding mistake.
